# CS301 Theory of Computation
Course Objectives:
Having successfully completed this course, the student will be able to:
* Distinguish different kinds of automata, and have an idea about problem complexity.
* Prove the type of language, and relate it to the adequate class of automata.
* Develop a deep appreciation of decidability, complexity theory and NP-Complete problems.

## Course Description:
This course is about the grammatical structure of programming language, different levels of machines (or automata), and different levels of languages (regular language, associated to finite-state automata; context-free language associated with push-down automata; and Turing machines).

## Topics Covered:
* Review of proof techniques; introduction to automata
* Deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata
* Epsilon-NFA's, regular expressions
* Properties of regular languages
* Context-free grammars
* Ambiguous grammars, pushdown automata
* PDA/CFG equivalence, deterministic PDA's
* Chomsky-normal-form grammars, pumping lemma
* Closure properties and algorithms for CFL's
* Introduction to Turing machines and Church hypothesis
* Variations of Turing machines
* NP-Complete problems
